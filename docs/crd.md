This content requirement documentation includes details on further changes to the clean website. 

We would like the following adding to our umbraco site

A new Hero Banner with a title a bodytext and an image,
A new accordion block that uses repeatable text strings, 

Both of these new element typoes should be added to the Elements / Content Models folder


When possible use existing data types, always serach for a suitable data type before creating new one. If you are going to create a new one ask me first and make me confirm before creating a new one. 
Add theae new element types to the Main Content BlockList as additional blocks

When creating new document types always get an existsing document type first to understand the structure, then amend the json to get the correct structure
