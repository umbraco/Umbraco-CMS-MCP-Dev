## Implementation Notes

1. **User Management**: âœ… Complete coverage (22 endpoints excluded for security). Implemented:
   - User read operations (admin-controlled, no creation/deletion/updates)
   - User permissions and access queries
   - User data management
   - Avatar management
   - Current user operations


3. **Health & Monitoring**: âœ… Health checks complete. Missing:
   - Profiling
   - Telemetry
   - Server monitoring

4. **Installation & Setup**: Missing all installation endpoints

5. **Security Features**: No implementation for security configuration and password management

## Recommendations

1. **ðŸŽ‰ COMPLETE**: All targetable endpoint groups now have 100% coverage!
2. **âœ… RelationType**: Now complete (100% coverage achieved)
3. **âœ… Relation**: Now complete (100% coverage achieved)
4. **Remaining**: Only ModelsBuilder endpoints remain unimplemented
5. **Low Priority**: Installation, Telemetry, and other utility endpoints are intentionally ignored

## Coverage Progress Tracking

To improve coverage:
1. Focus on completing groups that are already 80%+ implemented
2. Prioritize based on typical Umbraco usage patterns
3. Consider grouping related endpoints for batch implementation
4. Ensure comprehensive testing for each new endpoint

## Note on Tool Naming

Some tools use different naming conventions than their corresponding API endpoints:
- Search tools may map to `getItem*` endpoints
- By-id-array tools may map to `getItem*` endpoints
- This can cause discrepancies in automated coverage analysis

## Ignored Endpoints

Some endpoints are intentionally not implemented. See [IGNORED_ENDPOINTS.md](./IGNORED_ENDPOINTS.md) for:
- List of 53 ignored endpoints (import/export, security, privacy, system setup, and package-related)
- Rationale for exclusion
- Coverage statistics exclude these endpoints from calculations

Ignored groups now showing 100% coverage:
- Dictionary (2 import/export endpoints ignored)
- DocumentType (3 import/export endpoints ignored)
- MediaType (3 import/export endpoints ignored)
- Help (1 utility endpoint ignored)
- Import (1 analysis endpoint ignored)
- Indexer
- Install (3 system setup endpoints ignored)
- Package (9 package management endpoints ignored)
- PublishedCache (3 system performance endpoints ignored)
- Security (4 security-sensitive endpoints ignored)
- Segment (1 utility endpoint ignored)
- Telemetry (3 privacy-sensitive endpoints ignored)
- Upgrade (2 system setup endpoints ignored)
- User Group (3 permission escalation endpoints ignored)
- User (22 security-sensitive endpoints ignored)
